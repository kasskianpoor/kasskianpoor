- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... (I would leave this early because I am not going to update this like every 10 days. But for my current task as of May 24, 2022, I am learning to use docusign API and try to communicate with the api with OAuth2.0 protocol)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I just love working in a supporting team and I love supporting my team. I believe in sweating and working hard together. The learning is faster, there are subjects to talk, sometimes there are healthy competitions to come up with better solutions or better coding standards to make the code cleaner and much more benefits in working in team. So if you want to work together reach out.
