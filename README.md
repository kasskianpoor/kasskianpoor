- 👋 Hi, I’m Kass (or Kiarash) Kianpoor, a passionate and driven software engineer with rigorous discipline.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, networking (as in five layer network model ;P), creating organized and intuitive databases, mathematics, algorithm design, psychology, and dance choreography. 
- 🌱 As an ambitious senior full-stack developer, I'm actively dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest client-side technologies, as I've already acquired proficiency in many of them. To accomplish this, my plan is to enhance my Vue.js skills by delving into the components API and exploring Angular through learning and experimentation. (Oct 2023, this should be done by the end of Nov 2023)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people and build great products. I just love working in a supportive team and I love supporting my team. I believe in sweating and working hard together. Growing together makes learning faster and more fun. And working together in an organized way contributes to more efficiency and more accuracy. So if you want to work together reach out.
